Gonzaga Hackathon 2022 Project: Simon Says (Won 3rd Place)

Created by Matthew VonWahlde and Cameron Zheng

We created Simon Says using Arduino Uno Microcontollrers. The game is played by pressing the buttons in the sequence that was shown by the LEDs, with the length of the pattern increasing every round. We used two arduinos that were linked together using I2C (inter-integated circuits) protocol, with the main arduino controlling the main functionality of the game, including the buttons, LEDs, and the buzzer. The peripheral arduino wrote to the LCD screen.

We both went into this with almost no prior arduino experience, so this was a great learning experience for us. This was not our original idea, as we had two other teammates that were unfortunately not able to join us in the Hackathon. So, we decided to use our arduino kits and see what we could put together.

What we learned:
- Programming in the Arduino IDE
- Uploading code to an Arduino board
- Gathering data from buttons
- Lighting LEDs
- Playing sounds through a passive buzzer
- Linking Arduinos together using I2C
- Transmitting data across Arduinos
- Using an LCD screen
